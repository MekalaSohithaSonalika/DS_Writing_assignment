# Global Energy Review 

An interactive visualization of global CO2 emissions and energy consumption trends from 1750-2023.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need one of the following:
- Python 3.x
- Python 2.x
