                <h2>Global Coal Consumption Trends</h2>
                <p>
                    Coal consumption grew by 1.8% in 2024, marking the third consecutive year of growth. This increase was primarily driven by emerging economies in Asia, particularly for electricity generation and industrial use.

                        of CO2 equivalent. It reveals a dramatic overall increase in total emissions, 
                        particularly accelerating from the mid-20th century onwards. While Land Use

                        growth since the 1980s to become the largest single source by a significant margin. Methane
