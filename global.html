                <h2>Global Coal Consumption Trends</h2>
                <p>
                    Coal consumption grew by 1.8% in 2024, marking the third consecutive year of growth. This increase was primarily driven by emerging economies in Asia, particularly for electricity generation and industrial use.

                        of CO2 equivalent. It reveals a dramatic overall increase in total emissions, 
                        particularly accelerating from the mid-20th century onwards. While Land Use

                        growth since the 1980s to become the largest single source by a significant margin. Methane

                    <p class="chart-note">The graph vividly portrays a dramatic surge in greenhouse gas emissions, largely driven by energy production and consumption. 
                        Initially, Coal and Oil dominated as the primary emission sources, likely due to the industrial revolution and widespread adoption of fossil fuels for energy generation. 
                        This dominance underscores the historical dependence on traditional energy sources and their significant contribution to emissions. 
                        Around the mid-20th century, a pivotal shift occurred with the rise of Natural gas as a significant contributor, further accelerating the overall emission increase. 
                        This could be attributed to the perceived advantages of natural gas as a cleaner-burning fuel compared to coal and oil. 
                        This shift reflects the changing dynamics of energy production and its impact on greenhouse gas levels. 
                        While emissions from Methane, Industrial processes, Nitrous oxide, and CO2 flaring also increased, their overall contribution remained comparatively lower, possibly due to their relatively smaller scale of use or implementation of emission control measures. 
                        The continuous and accelerating growth of greenhouse gas emissions emphasizes the urgent need for sustainable energy alternatives and effective emission reduction measures to mitigate the effects of climate change. 
                        This is because continued reliance on fossil fuels poses significant risks to the environment and global climate stability. 
                        The graph highlights the critical role of transitioning towards cleaner energy sources to ensure a sustainable future.</p>

                        The graph depicts the trends in CO₂ emissions associated with trade activities for selected countries and the world from 1990 to 2021. 
                        A key observation is the significant increase in trade-related CO₂ emissions for China, surpassing all other countries and the world by a large margin. 
                        This could be attributed to China's rapid economic growth and its role as a major manufacturing and exporting hub. 
                        The United States initially had the highest emissions, but its growth rate slowed, and it was overtaken by China around 2005. 
                        India also shows a notable increase in emissions, although at a slower pace compared to China. 
                        Germany and the United Kingdom experienced relatively stable or slightly declining emissions. 
                        The overall trend indicates a continuous rise in global trade-related CO₂ emissions, highlighting the environmental impact of international trade and the need for sustainable trade practices. 
                        This emphasizes the importance of considering environmental factors in trade policies and promoting cleaner technologies to reduce emissions associated with global trade.</p>

                        CO₂ emerges as the dominant contributor, with its impact escalating steadily and accelerating in recent decades. 
                        While methane and nitrous oxide also contribute to warming, their effect is less pronounced. 
                        A notable event is the sharp increase in temperature change observed from the late 20th century onwards, coinciding with increased industrialization and greenhouse gas emissions.
