                <h3>Overview & Introduction</h3>
                <p>This dataset spans the years 1750â€“2023, covering COâ‚‚ emissions, energy consumption, and related metrics for countries worldwide, including 80 variables such as sector-specific emissions, GDP, and energy use. Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary driver of global climate change, and reducing them is critical to mitigating its worst impacts.</p>
                <p>However, debates persist over how responsibility should be shared across regions, countries, and individuals, shaped by differing metrics like annual emissions by country, per capita emissions, historical contributions, and adjustments for traded goods and services. These perspectives often yield contrasting narratives about accountability and progress.</p>

                <h3>About This Report</h3>
                <p>
                    As the first comprehensive analysis of global energy trends, this edition of the Global Energy Review examines data across all fuels, technologies, regions, and major countries, alongside energy-related COâ‚‚ emissions.</p>
                <p>
                    The report reveals that energy demand grew faster than average, driven by surging electricity needs in the power sectorâ€”nearly doubling overall energy demand due to cooling requirements, electrification trends, and the expansion of data centers. Rising consumption affected all energy sources, including oil, natural gas, coal, renewables, and nuclear power.</p>

            <!-- Hypothesis section -->
            <section class="hypothesis-section">
                <h3>Research Hypotheses</h3>
                <p>Based on our analysis of global energy trends, we propose the following hypotheses:</p>
                
                <div class="hypothesis-card">
                    <h4>Hypothesis 1: Many countries have decoupled economic growth from CO2 emissions, even if we take offshored production into account</h4>
                    <p>
                        Historically, CO2 emissions have been strongly correlated with how much money we have. This is particularly true for low-to-middle incomes. The richer we are, the more CO2 we emit. This is because we use more energy â€“ which often comes from burning fossil fuels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But this relationship no longer holds true at higher incomes. Many countries have managed to achieve economic growth while reducing emissions. They have decoupled the two.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Supporting Evidence:</h5>
                    <div class="interactive-container">
                        <iframe class="chart-iframe" src="plots/co2_gdp_comparison.html"></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        United States, Germany, United Kingdom: These countries show strong negative correlations between GDP per capita and COâ‚‚ emissions per capita. This indicates decoupling â€” their economies grew while per capita emissions declined.</p>
                    <p>
                        China and India: Show very strong positive correlations (~0.95â€“0.99), meaning GDP growth was closely tied to rising emissions. No decoupling observed â€” emissions are still strongly linked to economic expansion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        World overall: A moderately positive correlation (~0.79) suggests global COâ‚‚ emissions are still largely coupled with economic growth, driven by trends in developing nations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This decoupling is even more pronounced over the past two decades, since the turn of the millennium.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consumption-based emissions continued to rise in countries such as the US throughout the 1990s. But they have dropped a lot since 2005, alongside a rise in GDP. This is true for many more countries, which are shown in the static visualization below. Again, emissions are adjusted for trade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are two key reasons why emissions have fallen in these countries. First, some countries have managed to decouple energy use and economic growth. GDP has increased while total energy use has remained flat, or even fallen. But the second is the most important: countries are replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon energy. We can produce more energy, without the emissions that used to come with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It would be wrong to assume that this reduction in emissions in rich countries was only achieved by offshoring production overseas - by transferring emissions to manufacturing economies such as China and India. In the graph we see that consumption-based emissions - which adjust for emissions from goods that are imported or exported - have also fallen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These countries show that economic growth is not incompatible with reducing emissions.
                    </p>

                <div class="hypothesis-card">
                    <h4>Hypothesis 2: Global inequalities in CO2 emissions</h4>
                    <blockquote class="hypothesis-statement">
                        By 2030, developed economies will reduce emissions by 25-30% from 2020 levels while developing economies will increase emissions by 35-40%, resulting in net global emissions growth of 8-10%.
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        Positive slope: Emission share is increasing over time (e.g., Lower-income countries).                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Negative slope: Emission share is declining, often seen in High-income countries due to decarbonization or outsourcing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The worldâ€™s poorest are likely to be the most vulnerable. the poorest have contributed least to the problem through their emissions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The average person in high-income countries emits more than 30 times as much as those in low-income countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        High and upper-middle income countries account for a much larger share of emissions than their population. Despite being home to just under half of the world population, they emit more than 80% of worldâ€™s CO2.

                        Electricity generation will decarbonize three times faster than transportation and five times faster than industry through 2035, creating significant sectoral imbalances in emissions reduction trajectories.
