                <h3>Overview & Introduction</h3>
                <p>This dataset spans the years 1750â€“2023, covering COâ‚‚ emissions, energy consumption, and related metrics for countries worldwide, including 80 variables such as sector-specific emissions, GDP, and energy use. Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary driver of global climate change, and reducing them is critical to mitigating its worst impacts.</p>
                <p>However, debates persist over how responsibility should be shared across regions, countries, and individuals, shaped by differing metrics like annual emissions by country, per capita emissions, historical contributions, and adjustments for traded goods and services. These perspectives often yield contrasting narratives about accountability and progress.</p>

                <h3>About This Report</h3>
                <p>
                    As the first comprehensive analysis of global energy trends, this edition of the Global Energy Review examines data across all fuels, technologies, regions, and major countries, alongside energy-related COâ‚‚ emissions.</p>
                <p>
                    The report reveals that energy demand grew faster than average, driven by surging electricity needs in the power sectorâ€”nearly doubling overall energy demand due to cooling requirements, electrification trends, and the expansion of data centers. Rising consumption affected all energy sources, including oil, natural gas, coal, renewables, and nuclear power.                </p>

                <h3>Research Hypotheses</h3>
                <p>Based on our analysis of global energy trends, we propose the following hypotheses:</p>
                
                <div class="hypothesis-card">
                    <h4>Hypothesis 1: Acceleration of Renewable Energy Adoption</h4>
                    <blockquote class="hypothesis-statement">
                        <p>
                            Historically, CO2 emissions have been strongly correlated with how much money we have. This is particularly true for low-to-middle incomes. The richer we are, the more CO2 we emit. This is because we use more energy â€“ which often comes from burning fossil fuels.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But this relationship no longer holds true at higher incomes. Many countries have managed to achieve economic growth while reducing emissions. They have decoupled the two.
                        </p>

                        <li>Historical growth rates in renewable energy deployment over past five years</li>
                        <li>Declining levelized cost of energy for solar and wind compared to fossil fuels</li>
                        <li>Increasing policy mandates for renewable energy adoption</li>
                        <li>Growth patterns in global energy demand that outpace renewable capacity additions</li>

                    <h4>Hypothesis 2: Regional Divergence in Emissions Trajectories</h4>
                    <blockquote class="hypothesis-statement">
                        By 2030, developed economies will reduce emissions by 25-30% from 2020 levels while developing economies will increase emissions by 35-40%, resulting in net global emissions growth of 8-10%.

                    <blockquote class="hypothesis-statement">
                        Electricity generation will decarbonize three times faster than transportation and five times faster than industry through 2035, creating significant sectoral imbalances in emissions reduction trajectories.
