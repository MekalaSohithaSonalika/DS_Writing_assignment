                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary driver of global climate change. It's widely recognized that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world needs to urgently reduce emissions. But, how this responsibility is shared between regions, countries, and individuals has been an endless point of contention in international discussions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This debate arises from the various ways in which emissions are compared: as annual emissions by country; emissions per person; historical contributions; and whether they adjust for traded goods and services. These metrics can tell very different stories.

                <p>
                    This edition of the <em>Global Energy Review</em> is the first comprehensive depiction of the trends that took place in 2024 across the entire energy sector, covering data for all fuels and technologies, all regions and major countries, and energy-related carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The latest data show that the world's appetite for energy rose at a faster-than-average pace in 2024, resulting in higher demand for all energy sources, including oil, natural gas, coal, renewables and nuclear power. This growth was led by the power sector, with demand for electricity rising almost twice as fast as wider energy demand due to higher demand for cooling, rising consumption by factors: the electrification of forecast and the growth of data centers and

                <h3>Research Hypotheses</h3>
                <p>Based on our analysis of global energy trends, we propose the following hypotheses:</p>
                
                <div class="hypothesis-card">
                    <h4>Hypothesis 1: Many countries have decoupled economic growth from CO2 emissions, even if we take offshored production into account</h4>
                    <p>
                        Historically, CO2 emissions have been strongly correlated with how much money we have. This is particularly true for low-to-middle incomes. The richer we are, the more CO2 we emit. This is because we use more energy – which often comes from burning fossil fuels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But this relationship no longer holds true at higher incomes. Many countries have managed to achieve economic growth while reducing emissions. They have decoupled the two.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Supporting Evidence:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Historical growth rates in renewable energy deployment over past five years</li>
                        <li>Declining levelized cost of energy for solar and wind compared to fossil fuels</li>
                        <li>Increasing policy mandates for renewable energy adoption</li>
                        <li>Growth patterns in global energy demand that outpace renewable capacity additions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        United States, Germany, United Kingdom: These countries show strong negative correlations between GDP per capita and CO₂ emissions per capita. This indicates decoupling — their economies grew while per capita emissions declined.</p>
                    <p>
                        China and India: Show very strong positive correlations (~0.95–0.99), meaning GDP growth was closely tied to rising emissions. No decoupling observed — emissions are still strongly linked to economic expansion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        World overall: A moderately positive correlation (~0.79) suggests global CO₂ emissions are still largely coupled with economic growth, driven by trends in developing nations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This decoupling is even more pronounced over the past two decades, since the turn of the millennium.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consumption-based emissions continued to rise in countries such as the US throughout the 1990s. But they have dropped a lot since 2005, alongside a rise in GDP. This is true for many more countries, which are shown in the static visualization below. Again, emissions are adjusted for trade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are two key reasons why emissions have fallen in these countries. First, some countries have managed to decouple energy use and economic growth. GDP has increased while total energy use has remained flat, or even fallen. But the second is the most important: countries are replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon energy. We can produce more energy, without the emissions that used to come with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It would be wrong to assume that this reduction in emissions in rich countries was only achieved by offshoring production overseas - by transferring emissions to manufacturing economies such as China and India. In the graph we see that consumption-based emissions - which adjust for emissions from goods that are imported or exported - have also fallen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These countries show that economic growth is not incompatible with reducing emissions.

                        By 2030, developed economies will reduce emissions by 25-30% from 2020 levels while developing economies will increase emissions by 35-40%, resulting in net global emissions growth of 8-10%.

                    <p>
                        Positive slope: Emission share is increasing over time (e.g., Lower-income countries).

                    <p>
                        Negative slope: Emission share is declining, often seen in High-income countries due to decarbonization or outsourcing.

                        The world’s poorest are likely to be the most vulnerable. the poorest have contributed least to the problem through their emissions.

                    <p>
                        The average person in high-income countries emits more than 30 times as much as those in low-income countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        High and upper-middle income countries account for a much larger share of emissions than their population. Despite being home to just under half of the world population, they emit more than 80% of world’s CO2.
