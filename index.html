                <p>This dataset spans the years 1750-2023 and covers data on CO2 emissions, energy consumption, and related metrics for different countries. The data includes 80 variables, including CO2 emissions across multiple sectors, GDP, and energy consumption, among others.</p>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary driver of global climate change. It's widely recognized that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world needs to urgently reduce emissions. But, how this responsibility is shared between regions, countries, and individuals has been an endless point of contention in international discussions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This debate arises from the various ways in which emissions are compared: as annual emissions by country; emissions per person; historical contributions; and whether they adjust for traded goods and services. These metrics can tell very different stories.

                <p>
                    This edition of the <em>Global Energy Review</em> is the first comprehensive depiction of the trends that took place in 2024 across the entire energy sector, covering data for all fuels and technologies, all regions and major countries, and energy-related carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions.

                <p>
                    The latest data show that the world's appetite for energy rose at a faster-than-average pace in 2024, resulting in higher demand for all energy sources, including oil, natural gas, coal, renewables and nuclear power. This growth was led by the power sector, with demand for electricity rising almost twice as fast as wider energy demand due to higher demand for cooling, rising consumption by factors: the electrification of forecast and the growth of data centers and

                <h3>Research Hypotheses</h3>
                <p>Based on our analysis of global energy trends, we propose the following hypotheses:</p>
                
                <div class="hypothesis-card">
                    <h4>Hypothesis 1: Acceleration of Renewable Energy Adoption</h4>
                    <blockquote class="hypothesis-statement">
                        <p>
                            Historically, CO2 emissions have been strongly correlated with how much money we have. This is particularly true for low-to-middle incomes. The richer we are, the more CO2 we emit. This is because we use more energy â€“ which often comes from burning fossil fuels.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But this relationship no longer holds true at higher incomes. Many countries have managed to achieve economic growth while reducing emissions. They have decoupled the two.

                    <blockquote class="hypothesis-statement">
                        By 2030, developed economies will reduce emissions by 25-30% from 2020 levels while developing economies will increase emissions by 35-40%, resulting in net global emissions growth of 8-10%.

                        Electricity generation will decarbonize three times faster than transportation and five times faster than industry through 2035, creating significant sectoral imbalances in emissions reduction trajectories.
