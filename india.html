                    Natural gas demand grew by 2.5% in 2024, with LNG trade expanding to meet growing demand in Asia and to replace reduced pipeline gas flows in Europe. The fuel maintained its role as a transition fuel in many energy systems.

                        The provided graph illustrates the historical trend of India's greenhouse 
                        gas emissions by source from roughly 1850 to 2020, measured in Gigatonnes 
                        of CO2 equivalent. It reveals a dramatic overall increase in total emissions, 
                        particularly accelerating from the mid-20th century onwards. While Land Use 
                        Change CO2 was the dominant emission source in the mid-19th century and saw 
                        a significant spike around the 1950s before declining, the profile has fundamentally 
                        shifted. By the end of the period, coal combustion clearly dominates, displaying exponential 
                        growth since the 1980s to become the largest single source by a significant margin. Methane 
                        emissions have also shown a substantial and consistent rise throughout the entire period, 
                        establishing themselves as the second-largest contributor. Oil consumption follows as the 
                        third-largest source, with steady growth beginning around the 1960s. Nitrous oxide emissions 
                        show a slower but steady increase, while contributions from natural gas and CO2 flaring 
                        remain comparatively minor throughout the depicted history. Overall, the graph highlights 
                        a major transformation towards an emissions profile heavily driven by fossil fuels, especially coal.</p>

                    <p class="chart-note">The graph illustrates a complex interplay between economic growth, population, and CO2 emissions in India. 
                        While CO2 per capita generally increases, reflecting population growth and rising living standards, notable improvements in energy efficiency and economic output relative to carbon emissions can also be observed. 
                        CO2 per unit of energy and CO2 per GDP have both decreased over time, potentially due to economic liberalization (1991), a focus on renewable energy, climate change policies like the National Action Plan on Climate Change, and shifts in industrial practices. 
                        India's commitment to economic growth is evident alongside its efforts to decouple that growth from carbon emissions, resulting in improved energy efficiency and sustainability. 
                        However, with a steadily rising population, the graph underscores the need to continue advancing emission reduction strategies to achieve India's climate goals and align with global sustainability efforts.</p>

                    <p class="chart-note">The graph reveals a consistent upward trend in CO2 emissions across various sectors, reflecting India's economic and industrial growth. 
                        All three categories - total CO2, Cement CO2, and Other Industry CO2 - have increased steadily. 
                        This trend aligns with major events and developments in India, such as economic liberalization (1991), which spurred industrial activity and infrastructure development. 
                        While policies like the National Action Plan on Climate Change aim to mitigate emissions, the graph suggests these efforts are yet to significantly impact the overall emissions trajectory. 
                        The growth in Cement CO2 highlights the significant contribution of construction and infrastructure development to India's carbon footprint. 
                        Industrial processes remain a major driver of CO2 emissions, emphasizing the need for targeted mitigation measures across these sectors to achieve sustainability goals.</p>
