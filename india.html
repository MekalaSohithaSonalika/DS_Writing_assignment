                <p>
                    Natural gas demand grew by 2.5% in 2024, with LNG trade expanding to meet growing demand in Asia and to replace reduced pipeline gas flows in Europe. The fuel maintained its role as a transition fuel in many energy systems.

                        The provided graph illustrates the historical trend of India's greenhouse 
                        gas emissions by source from roughly 1850 to 2020, measured in Gigatonnes 
                        of CO2 equivalent. It reveals a dramatic overall increase in total emissions, 
                        particularly accelerating from the mid-20th century onwards. While Land Use 
                        Change CO2 was the dominant emission source in the mid-19th century and saw 
                        a significant spike around the 1950s before declining, the profile has fundamentally 
                        shifted. By the end of the period, coal combustion clearly dominates, displaying exponential 
                        growth since the 1980s to become the largest single source by a significant margin. Methane 
                        emissions have also shown a substantial and consistent rise throughout the entire period, 
                        establishing themselves as the second-largest contributor. Oil consumption follows as the 
                        third-largest source, with steady growth beginning around the 1960s. Nitrous oxide emissions 
                        show a slower but steady increase, while contributions from natural gas and CO2 flaring 
                        remain comparatively minor throughout the depicted history. Overall, the graph highlights 
                        a major transformation towards an emissions profile heavily driven by fossil fuels, especially coal.</p>
